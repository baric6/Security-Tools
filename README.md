Microsoft acquired Winternals and its assets on July 18, 2006. Microsoft included this tool, firstly, in its Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack 
(MDOP) and changed its name to Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT). This tool has been developed further and its latest version is 7.0. 
Please consider that each version works only with some operating systems. For example, DaRT 5.0 only works with Windpws XP and Windows Server 2003,
6.0 works with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
