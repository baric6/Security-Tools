# overlord - red team automation
Overlord provides a python-based console CLI which is used to build Red Teaming infrastructure in an automated way. The user has to provide inputs by using the toolâ€™s modules (e.g. C2, Email Server, HTTP web delivery server, Phishing server etc.) and the full infra / modules and scripts will be generated automatically on a cloud provider of choice. Currently supports AWS and Digital Ocean. The tool is still under development and it was inspired and uses the Red-Baron Terraform implementation found on Github.![d9e1b1491ad5b2245f9d7be1000157b2.png](../../../_resources/d9e1b1491ad5b2245f9d7be1000157b2.png)
