# DC3-MWCP malware parser
DC3 Malware Configuration Parser (DC3-MWCP) is a framework for parsing configuration information from malware. The information extracted from malware includes items such as addresses, passwords, filenames, and mutex names. A parser module is usually created per malware family. DC3-MWCP is designed to help ensure consistency in parser function and output, ease parser development, and facilitate parser sharing. DC3-MWCP supports both analyst directed analysis and large-scale automated execution, utilizing either the native python API, a REST API, or a provided command line tool. DC3-MWCP is authored by the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3).
