# (malware) Catalyzer analyzer 
A small tool that helps Incident responders and SOC analysts do a quick and initial analysis/assessment of malicious files that could contain some Powershells, WMI, Vbs, and many more scripting languages inside them. It will even try to detect if the file includes some sort of executable inside it. For now, you can use it for the new wave of malicious .one or OneNote files. I hope it helps.
